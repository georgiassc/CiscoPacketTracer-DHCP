# CiscoPacketTracer-DHCP

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the configuration of a DHCP server to automatically provide IP addresses to devices in a simulated network in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network has two switches configured with different subnets, ensuring logical separation of the connected devices.

## Network Topology

**Switch One**: Configured with the address 192.168.10.1

**Switch Two**: Configured with the address 192.168.20.1

**Router**: Responsible for dynamically distributing IP addresses to the network devices
